<a href="/public/uploads/2007/05/chess.jpg" title="chess.jpg"><img src="/public/uploads/2007/05/chess.jpg" alt="chess.jpg" align="right" /></a>Hello

Over the past 2 months I have posted 30 chess puzzles and ~50 people have subscribed to the daily chess puzzle feed but in the last two weeks I have been letting the quality of the posts slip there has been at lest 4 bugs in the last two week and thats not fair to my readers.

I will no longer be posting regular daily chess puzzles any more.  I will however post the really good ones that I come across every once in a while.

Feed free to <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/about/">submit</a> any good chess puzzles that you come across. (FEN, PNG, ect)

Please <a href="http://www.abluestar.com/about/">contact me</a> if you would like to take over the daily chess puzzle feed. I would give full credit for any puzzle that you submit and I have set up a bunch of tools to easily create the chess puzzle images from FEN numbers.
